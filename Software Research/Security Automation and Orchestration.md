## Security Automation and Orchestration

###Overview
####Why is cyber security important?

It is important because it protects all important information and data from the theft, hackers and prevents from further damage.
“Without a cybersecurity program your organization cannot defend and protect itself from the threats and viruses and it makes your organization an easy target for hackers and theft.
Your business is protected against potentially catastrophic disruptions caused by cyberattacks.”

#### Introduction of SAO (Security Automation and Orchestration)
##### Implementing security automation and orchestration

What is Orchestration and Automation?<br>
•	Orchestration is a method of connecting security tool plus integrating disparate security system to streamline processes and power automation.

“Which means making the security teams more effective.”

•	Automation is the process of executing security operations relates tasks, without human interventions.

“Automation spans every aspect of security. Defensive side of automation is It covers everything from prevention and detection to response or remediation. “


##### Objective of the presentation<br>
“The objective of this PowerPoint presentation is to provide the board of directors at ACME with a comprehensive knowledge understanding about the Security Automation and Orchestration and to recommend a security automation and orchestration solution to strengthen the security infrastructure and customers data.”

“Educate the audience about the benefits of Automation and Orchestration, and its relevance in addressing current cybersecurity challenges.”

“With overall, the objective is to equip the boards of directors with knowledge and insight necessary to make informed decisions about improving ACME’s cybersecurity through the implementation of Security Automation and Orchestration.”


##### Benefits of implementing in the organization.

Reduced manual operations & standardized processes – Security automation relieves SOC analysts of mundane, repetitive tasks and includes them in an overall process of how to handle any given incident. A good SOAR platform will incorporate these tasks into playbooks that lay out the end-to-end incident response steps.
“Security automation and orchestration is making tasks easier by doing them more automatically and following the same steps each time”.

Improved and Faster Response Time - Security orchestration aggregates multiple related alerts from disparate systems into a single incident. Saving even more time, security automation enables the system to respond to alerts with no human intervention whenever possible. Bringing context to textual data and automation to the decision-making process enables a quicker alert handling process.
“With automation and orchestration, you don’t have to wait for the analyst or IT department to respond, the system will respond to the threat immediately”.

Enhanced Threat Detection and Mitigation – Threat intelligence provides useful information but is too often the tree that falls with no one to hear it. SOC analysts are constantly dealing with information overload. Adding threat intelligence to the mix piles on more information to sort through.  The best SOAR platforms can ingest threat intelligence and automatically correlate it with events in real time. This takes the burden of SOC analysts and provides immediately actionable information for incident response teams.
“With security automation and orchestration, detection and mitigation of threat is enhanced because it can distinguish the threat easily.”

Streamlined Security Operations - Each element of SOAR contributes to the streamlining of security operations. Security orchestration aggregates data incoming from a variety of sources. Security automation, meanwhile, can easily handle low-priority alerts and incidents through the use of automated playbooks. Incident response takes the heat-of-the-moment guesswork out of event handling, limiting cyberattack dwell time and overall impact on the business. 
“What is the Streamlined Security Operation? To streamline an organization or process means to make it more efficient by removing unnecessary parts of it, but to streamline security operations, consider implementing automation tasks tools for routine tasks, conduct regular threat assessments, prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, and ensure clear communication within your security team.”

Easy technology & tools integration - One of the benefits of security orchestration is the ability to correlate alerts from a wide variety of products and technologies. A SOAR platform should be able to integrate with products across various security technologies: Cloud Security, Data Enrichment, Email Security, Endpoint Security, Forensics & Malware Analysis, Identity and Access Management, IT and Infrastructure, Network Security, SIEM & Log Management , Threat Intelligence, Vulnerability & Risk Management. The integration of these products into your SOAR platform should be easy. A self-service marketplace can quickly access the integration for a specific product. From there, integration is as easy as clicking a button and snapping components into a playbook.  

Reduced Human Error – Automation minimizes the risk of human error by executing security tasks accurately and consistently by automating routine tasks, organization can mitigate the potential impact of human mistakes on their security posture.
Cost Savings – A typical enterprises will experience significant savings by integrating a security orchestration and automation into its model. 90% on reporting 80% on playbook creation 70% on alert handling 60% on analyst training 30% on shift management.
“It will reduce your expenses.”
Automated reporting & metrics capabilities - Automated reporting not only makes life easier, but it also eliminates the need for manually produced metrics. By allowing SOC staff to pull reports on demand — preferably with one click — or automatically on a schedule, businesses receive reliable and timely metrics for each reporting period. To further simplify this process, most SOAR tools provide reporting templates and the ability to generate custom reports.

“Overall, can significantly strengthen it’s cybersecurity posture, and mitigate security threats while optimizing resources, utilization and reduced operation costs.”

##### Concern:
Sometimes you don’t want to automate everything and that’s okay, after automating all those tasks that mentioned, an analyst probably still should come in and confirm that it is a phishing email.
“With automation we have eliminated most of the tedious work analysts have to do. Now they can click a button yes or no, if yes, the automated remediation process kicks off otherwise, we can automate the sending of the email to the original user who submitted it and tell them it was not phishing email this is the key benefit of bringing in orchestration. Orchestration and automation can work together to empower security teams offensive and defensive and know them to be more effective and focus on analysis and decision making rather than manual tedious and time intensive tasks.”

#### Challenges:

##### Disparate Environments and Tools<br>
There are so many environments, networks in an organization, devices, tools and product. The problem is none of these are connected.

###### Overwhelmed Security Teams<br>
One of the major problems, dealing with a complexity of attacks different tools that exacerbate the problem, again none of these are connected. They get so many incidents and alerts in every single day and there’s not enough people to handle all of attacks coming in.
Cyber Security Talent Shortage
Even if they can hire people, and they want to hire more people to fill these roles, there’s not enough to hire with the skill needed. This boils down to the teams can’t keep up.

##### Benefits to ACME’s customers<br>
The core benefit of automation and orchestration security is that it makes practitioners lives easier and allows them to be more efficient at their jobs.

### Overall Conclusion and Recommendations

##### Recommendations <br>
•	Instead of spending time on manual tasks, teams and practitioners can utilize the time and focus more on strategic value-add projects such as conducting deeper analysis and implementing proactive security measures, with the use of security orchestration and automation it minimizes the work needed.

###### 3 signs you should automate:
* Is it a routine?
    - It needs to be done on a very regular basis. For example, everyday security teams check their inboxes to see if anyone has forwarded any potential “phishing emails”.
* Is it tedious?
	  - This involve a very specific set of actions that need to get done which could include seeing if there are URLs or attachments in those emails submitting hashes to virus total detonating any attachments in a sandbox like cuckoo.
* Is it time-intensive? 
	  - Something that leaves to no room for higher value and more strategic work for example rather than helping developers build security into their development lifecycle security teams spend their time deleting those phishing emails from all their employee’s inbox.
