## Understanding Binary

Computer understand only 2 things
* Power on = 1
* Power off = 0
<br>
This is perhaps the origin of the power button symbol.<br>
Computers use a binary number system of only 0s and 1s.

### Binary Conversion

Say that the binary number is 101001 need to convert to normal (Denary).<br>
Number can be written into the binary table

          128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
                    1   0  1  0  0  1

Conversion computation. Simply multiply out each placeholder with its  corresponding value, the sum of everything.

          (32 * 1) + (16 * 0) + (8 * 1) + (4 * 0) + (2 * 0) + (1 * 1) = 41

The answer in this case is 41.
