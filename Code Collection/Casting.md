##  Process of Casting
### Casting.py - File name
Casting is important, particularly when getting a user to type in input. 
The default input type is 'string', but it may be required that the user types in a number, in which case, casting is needed.

variable set to integer

    my_score = 201
 
    print("The type of my_score is ", type(my_score),"\n")
    print("my_score is ", my_score,"\n")
 
    print("Casting to a string...\n")

variable cast to string

    my_score = str(my_score)
 
    print("The type of my_score is now ", type(my_score),"\n")
    print("my_score is ", my_score,"\n")
